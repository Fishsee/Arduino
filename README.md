### Makerguide C++ Style Guide for Arduino Projects

#### 1. Introduction
This style guide provides guidelines for writing consistent, readable, and maintainable code for Arduino projects in C++. Following these conventions will help in maintaining a uniform coding style and make it easier for others to understand and contribute to your project.

#### 2. File Structure
- **Header Files (.h)**: Use header files for declarations and include guards to prevent multiple inclusions.
- **Source Files (.cpp)**: Use source files for definitions.

#### 3. Naming Conventions
- **File Names**: Use lowercase with underscores (e.g., `file_name.h`).
- **Class Names**: Use CamelCase (e.g., `ClassName`).
- **Function Names**: Use camelCase (e.g., `functionName`).
- **Variable Names**: Use descriptive names in camelCase (e.g., `variableName`).
- **Constants**: Use uppercase with underscores (e.g., `CONSTANT_NAME`).

#### 4. Indentation and Formatting
- Use 2 spaces per indentation level.
- Keep lines within 80 characters.
- Place opening braces on the same line as the statement (e.g., `if`, `while`).

#### 5. Comments
- Use `//` for single-line comments.
- Use `/* */` for multi-line comments.
- Document the purpose and functionality of classes, methods, and important code sections.

#### 6. Functions
- Keep functions short and focused on a single task.
- Use descriptive names and document the parameters and return values.

#### 7. Classes
- Encapsulate data and provide public methods for accessing and modifying it.
- Use constructors for initializing member variables.

#### 8. Error Handling
- Check for errors and handle them gracefully.
- Use return values and error codes where appropriate.

#### 9. Libraries
- Include only the necessary libraries.
- Document any external dependencies.

#### 10. Code Reviews
- Regularly review code with team members to ensure consistency and quality.
